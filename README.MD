# Installing Node.js and Express

1. Install Node.js from the official website: https://nodejs.org/en/download/
2. Verify that Node.js is installed by running the following command in your terminal:
   ```
   node -v
   ```
   This should print the version of Node.js that you just installed.
3. Create a new directory for your project and navigate into it:
   ```
   mkdir server
   cd server
   ```
4. Initialize a new Node.js project by running the following command:
   ```
   npm init
   ```
   This will create a `package.json` file in your project directory.
5. Install Express by running the following command:
   ```
   npm install express
   ```
